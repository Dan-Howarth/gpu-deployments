# GPU Deployments of the FSDL Text Recognizer

This repo collects up some example GPU deployments of a simple deep network, the
[Full Stack Deep Learning Text Recognizer](https://fsdl.me/2022-repo),
which combines a classic ResNet encoder with a vanilla Transformer decoder
to recognize images of handwritten text from the
[IAM Handwriting Database](https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database).

Each deployment is on a different branch.
